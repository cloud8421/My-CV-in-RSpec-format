A little trick, my CV in RSpec format. Nothing complicated, just a funny way to talk about me.

It requires Rake and RSpec to run. I didn't include a .Gemfile just because it's really straightforward.

It includes a .rvmrc file to isolate everything.

The steps needed to run are very simple:

    gem install rake rspec
    
    rake
    
Hope you enjoy :-)
